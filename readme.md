# About

A system for supporting a library business. Users can create an account on the mobile app and browse, wishlist and borrow books. Administrators (librarians) use a desktop app to track all the reservations and keep track of which customer borrowed which book. There is also a penalty system for repeated offenders such as in case of damaging a book or returning it late. 

API and database are dockerized.
